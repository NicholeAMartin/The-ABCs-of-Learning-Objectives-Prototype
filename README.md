# Description

## Task
Create a five minute prototype of a learning module to teach new instructional designers how to write learning objectives.
## Audience
New instructional designers at the company
 
# Prototype Creation
## Learning Principles & Theories
Narrative-based Learning
* Definition: Stories provide a non-threatening way to connect with the learner, pique their interest, and get learner buy-in.
* Prototype application: Learners hear the story of Litzy, an instructional designer, who needs help writing a learning objective after receiving corrective feedback from her supervisor. 

Emotional Engagement
* Definition: People engage with content better when they emotionally connect to the avatar or protagonist of the story.
* Prototype application: The protagonist, Litzy, is also an instructional designer like the learner. Litzy is also facing an issue at work, which all professionals deal with at some point.

Constructivism
* Definition: People learn best when they relate the content to prior learning experiences. 
* Prototype application: Learners use their own instructional design know-how to interpret feedback from a supervisor.

Segmenting Principle
* Definition: People better digest and follow learning when the information is presented in small sections rather than in a long continuous unit.
* Prototype application: Multiple slides present the information to the learner rather than a single video or slide.

Personalization Principle
* Definition: People learn better from materials that have a conversational and informal tone rather than a formal tone.
* Prototype application: Text and voiceover are in a casual, friendly tone that uses contractions, encouraging language, and simple terminology to sound more like natural speech.
 
## Rapid Design Process
1. Perform an internet search to briefly review articles on writing learning objectives to get instructional ideas.
2. Brainstorm a scenario and story to help teach the concepts and keep learners engaged.
3. Decide on software to use to design a prototype (i.e., Articulate Storyline).
4. Use a [written storyboard](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tFzVz7j1jxWmrg24f2iFIdUY7Pc9SxXkhm6MwzE8F-c/edit?usp=sharing) template to plan the prototype's content, graphics, on-screen text, and button. Check the content in Grammarly for spelling and grammar.
5. Visit Canva to quickly find a slide template and color scheme. Export template and color values to use in the prototype.
6. Start a new project in Articulate Storyline. Design an eye-catching opening slide that introduces the character, Litzy.
7. Create and style 1 multiple choice quiz slide—duplicate quiz slide including feedback to use throughout the prototype.
8. Choose 2 characters for the prototype and duplicate them on each slide. Change their poses, crop, and resize as needed.
9. Copy and paste on-screen text from the storyboard slide. Add default animations (e.g., fade and wipe) to text boxes and shapes to quickly add a sense of movement and smoothness.
10. After creating 1 text-based slide, duplicate the slide and replace the text on each new slide to save on development time.
11. Record audio directly into Articulate Storyline. Rough edit audio to remove overly distracting elements like taps on the microphone.
12. Time up slide elements with the audio.
13. Add a slide to ask the learner a question and capture their response to a thought-provoking question. The goal is to stimulate the instructional designer’s previous knowledge on the topic.
14. Preview the entire project. Fix any typos or errors. Remove the slide that pushes the presentation over the 5 minute mark.
15. Publish the prototype. Host the presentation using Git and GitHub Pages.
